# LifeLens

This project examines the practice of ethics in modern startups and entrepreneurial activities. Our group has formed a fictitious company creating a feasible/real technology product or service. We are to develop the 4 items below that will discuss the fundamental concept behind our company, the ethical impacts of our business and also highlight its Cultural and Ethical Policies and selected Ethics Board members. Please treat this as a real startup.
